# ego — Command language

Date: 2026-08-19. Status: **§4 (output contracts) ratified by maintainer
2026-08-21 — §4.1 through §4.5 in full, not a subset.** The rest of this
document remains proposed.



## 1. Design principles

1. **The common case costs zero ceremony.** `ego "fix the failing test"` — no
   subcommand, no flags.
2. **stdin/stdout are the API.** Prompt from argv, stdin, or file; events out as
   JSONL; meaningful exit codes. `git diff | ego run "review this" | jq` works.
3. **TTY-aware defaults, explicit overrides.** On a pipe: no colour, no spinner,
   quiet progress. Output *format* never changes implicitly — a script that
   wants JSON says so.
4. **One grammar everywhere.** The permission rule you pass as `--allow`, write
   in config, and see in `/permissions` is the same string. The event you see in
   `--output jsonl` is the same event in the session file and on ACP.
5. **Every interactive capability has a non-interactive spelling.** Nothing is
   locked behind the REPL (Codex's `exec` lesson; pi's `print`/`json` modes).

## 2. Command set

```
ego [PROMPT]                  interactive session (prompt submitted if given)
ego run [PROMPT]              headless one-shot; PROMPT from argv, -f FILE, or stdin
ego resume [ID] [PROMPT]      continue a session; no ID = latest in this workspace
ego ls                        list sessions (this workspace; --all for every one)
ego fork <ID>                 branch a session
ego export <ID>               render a session (--format md|json|jsonl)
ego mcp    add|rm|ls|login    MCP server management
ego mcp-server                serve ego AS an MCP server on stdio: scoped
                              run/continue/cancel/status tools (delegation
                              surface for Claude, Codex, CI orchestrators)
ego auth   login|logout|status [PROVIDER]
ego models [--provider P] [--refresh]
ego config get|set|unset|ls|edit
ego rules  ls|allow|deny|revoke|remember|explain   (permission rules,
                              stable IDs; `explain <tool> <args>` shows the
                              canonical intent + matching rule, dry)
ego usage  [--period P] [--json]             cost and token report
ego acp                       serve ACP on stdio (the embedding surface)
ego doctor                    environment / config / credential diagnosis
```

Notes:

- `ego run` is the scripting workhorse. `ego resume <id> "next step"` chains
  scripted multi-turn conversations — a pipeline can carry a session through
  several stages. One session pool across interactive and headless runs
  (Codex split them and had to add `--include-non-interactive` to re-merge).
- There is deliberately **no bespoke RPC mode**: embedders get `ego acp`.
  pi invented `rpc`/`json` modes; ACP is that, standardised.
- Stdin contract (Codex's, the cleanest surveyed): prompt as argument; `-`
  reads the prompt from stdin; with *both* argv prompt and piped stdin, stdin
  is appended as a delimited context block.
- `ego export --sanitize` redacts secrets before a transcript leaves the
  machine (opencode's idea; mandatory for CI artifacts).

## 3. Flags (the argument grammar)

Grouped; all long flags, short forms only for the hot five
(`-m -q -v -C -f`).

**Model and generation**

```
-m, --model P/M         provider/model slug: anthropic/claude-opus-5,
                        openrouter/z-ai/glm-4.7, ollama/qwen3 …
                        local daemons (ollama, lmstudio, vllm, llamacpp) are
                        first-class providers, catalogued live from the daemon
    --offline           no non-loopback egress from ego's own HTTP transport:
                        loopback addresses and `localhost` only, no DNS, no
                        proxy, and every redirect hop re-checked. It does not
                        confine spawned commands, hooks or MCP transports, and
                        it cannot stop an admitted local daemon from relaying
                        upstream itself (see `crates/ego-ai/src/http.rs`)
    --thinking L        off|min|low|medium|high|xhigh|max   (pi's scale)
    --system TEXT|@file          replace system prompt
    --append-system TEXT|@file   append to it
```

**Permissions and confinement** (one axis pair, Codex-style)

```
    --mode M            plan|default|auto|edits|yolo   shortcuts: --plan, --yolo
                        auto = judge model evaluates the canonical call and
                        allows/denies/escalates (permissions.judge in config:
                        a cheap tier like gpt-5.6-luna or GLM, or local ollama)
    --sandbox S         ro|workspace|off             (off = classifier only)
    --allow RULE        repeatable   e.g. --allow 'bash(git *)' --allow 'net(api.github.com)'
    --deny RULE         repeatable; deny beats allow
```

Rules follow a published formal grammar matched against the *canonical* call
(resolved paths, argv, endpoints — never rendered shell strings); the
mode × sandbox matrix is published and contradictory combinations are
rejected, not guessed. Every control is individually disableable; hard
ceilings come only from an administrator's `/etc/ego`.

**Session**

```
    --session NAME      named session (create or attach)
    --session-id UUID   caller-SUPPLIED id — no capture-then-resume dance
    --ephemeral         no session written
    --session-dir DIR   override store location
```

**Scripting contract**

```
    --output F          text|json|jsonl              (default text)
    --schema S          JSON Schema (@file or inline): the final answer MUST
                        validate; ego re-prompts on mismatch, fails code 1 after
                        --schema-retries N (default 2)
    --budget B          hard cap: '2.5$' or '400k' tokens → exit 5 when hit
    --max-turns N       cap agent turns
    --timeout DUR       wall clock: '90s', '10m' → exit 124
    --retry N           provider retries, delivery-certainty-aware: only
                        DefinitelyUnsent attempts retry automatically
    --fallback P/M      ordered model degradation chain (repeatable)
-f, --file FILE         prompt/agent file (§5)
    --var K=V           template variable for agent files (repeatable)
-C DIR                  run as if started in DIR (git-style)
-c, --set K=V           dotted-path config override, value parsed as TOML
                        (Codex's mechanism: -c 'sandbox.mode="workspace"')
    --profile NAME      layer [profile.NAME] from config (§7)
    --bare              no ambient discovery even in a trusted workspace
-q / -v / --no-color
```

**Attachments and tools**

```
    --attach PATH|URL   repeatable; files, images, URLs as context
    --tools LIST        restrict builtin tools;  --no-tools for pure generation
    --mcp NAME|@cfg.json  attach MCP server for this invocation (repeatable)
```

## 4. Output contracts

### 4.1 `--output json` (one object on stdout at completion)

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "session": "s_9f2k…",
  "result": "…final assistant text or --schema-validated object…",
  "exit_reason": "done|budget|max_turns|timeout|permission|error",
  "turns": 4,
  "usage": { "uncached_input_tokens": 8110, "cache_read_tokens": 40100,
             "cache_write_tokens": 1200, "output_tokens": 3120 },
  "context": { "used_tokens": 51410, "provenance": "generation_boundary" },
  "cost": { "state": "known",
            "total": { "amount": "0.083", "currency": "USD" } }
}
```

`usage` is the sum of the per-generation deltas, split by the categories that
are *priced differently*; it is a flow and only grows. `context` is the
occupancy *level* of the live context window and goes **down** after a
compaction, so it is reported separately and never derived from `usage`.
`cost.amount` is an exact decimal **string**, not a JSON number — binary floats
cannot represent a price. `cost.state` is `unstarted` before the first priced
generation, and `{"state":"unknown","reason":…}` once any generation could not
be priced: an unpriceable generation makes the session total unknown rather
than silently under-reported.

### 4.2 `--output jsonl` (one event per line, live)



- `session.started` carries a **`capabilities` string array** (feature
  detection by name, never version parsing) and error arrays
  (`mcp_errors`, `hook_errors`) **present only when non-empty** — a CI gate
  is a presence check.
- The **final result rides the terminal event** (`turn.completed` of the last
  turn) — no `--output-last-message` temp-file dance.
- **One error field.** `ok: bool` plus `exit_reason`; no second status field
  that can contradict it (Claude's `subtype:"success"` + `is_error:true`).
- JSONL mode is a strict superset of text-mode resilience: any error text
  mode survives, jsonl survives as an event.
- The schema is versioned in the header and published; same schema as the
  session file and the ACP projection — learn it once.

### 4.3 Exit codes

```
0 done        1 task failed (agent reports failure / schema never validated)
2 usage error 3 permission needed in non-interactive and not granted
4 provider/network error   5 budget or turn limit   124 timeout
130 SIGINT    143 SIGTERM
```

Only Gemini ever documented an exit-code table; Codex and Claude collapse
almost everything into 0/1. Scripting needs the distinctions (retry on 4,
escalate on 3, alert on 5). The shutdown contract is explicit (Claude's, which
is right): on SIGTERM abort the turn, kill the tool process tree, run
session-end hooks, flush the session file, exit 143. Flags are never removed
silently: a retired flag errors **by name** with its replacement.

### 4.4 Non-interactive posture: untrusted by default

Headless runs never hang on a prompt: an unresolvable permission ⇒ exit 3, with
the denied action in the JSON result. Scripts opt in with `--allow` rules, a
stronger `--sandbox`, or `--yolo` — never by answering prompts.

### 4.5 Parse and lifecycle contract (normative before release)

The grammar ships with: a command × flag **applicability matrix** (no flag
documented before its contract is implemented — per-milestone availability
table); a normative **input-precedence algorithm** over argv prompt, `-`,
piped stdin, `-f`, `--attach` and agent-file body, with `--` reserved for
prompt disambiguation (`ego -- run` prompts the word "run"); explicit
mutually-exclusive groups (`--session`/`--session-id`/`--ephemeral`, mode ×
sandbox); a defined winner when limits collide (budget beats schema-retry:
exit 5); **stdout is protocol-clean** in json/jsonl/acp modes, all diagnostics
on stderr; agent files are a versioned format. CLI reference and completions
are generated from the same clap definitions and snapshot-tested.



`--instructions FILE` is the headless opt-in and is **not** ambient: it names
a file rather than discovering one, so it survives `Posture::Bare` and
*replaces* the discovered set rather than adding to it. `--bare` together with
`--instructions` is a conflict for the applicability matrix above, not for the
loader — from a resolved posture alone, "the user demanded bare" and "the
workspace is untrusted" are the same value and want opposite answers. See
`docs/decisions/2026-08-21-instructions-a-workspace-may-hand-a-model.md`.

## 5. Agent files — the scripting language

An **executable agent file** is YAML frontmatter + prompt body. Same format
family as skills; `--var` fills `{{placeholders}}`; shebang makes it a program:

```
#!/usr/bin/env -S ego run -f
---
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-5
mode: edits
sandbox: workspace
allow: ["bash(cargo *)"]
schema: "@review-schema.json"
vars: [severity]
---
Review the staged diff. Report only findings of severity {{severity}} or
higher. Output must match the schema.
```

```bash
chmod +x review.ego
./review.ego --var severity=major | jq '.result.findings'
```

Frontmatter keys mirror the CLI flags one-to-one — the file *is* a saved
command line plus a prompt. Nothing else examined has this as a first-class,
executable unit (Claude Code's slash commands are REPL-only; pi's prompt
templates are not executables).

## 6. Interactive surface (kept deliberately small)

Slash commands: `/help /model /thinking /mode /plan /yolo /permissions /mcp
/sessions /fork /compact /clear /usage /export /doctor /quit`. History,
completion and multiline via reedline. The permission prompt is fx's proven
dialog: number keys choose, **Tab amends the proposed command**, Enter
confirms, Esc cancels.

## 7. Configuration

```
/etc/ego/config.toml      system    (admin: fleet defaults + non-relaxable
                                     deny/budget ceilings — the only source
                                     of ceilings; ego itself imposes none)
~/.ego/config.toml        user      (EGO_HOME overrides ~/.ego)
.ego/config.toml          project   (committed; no secrets)
.ego/config.local.toml    project-local (gitignored)
```

TOML, flag-mirroring keys, `[profile.NAME]` sections selected with
`--profile NAME` (Codex's idea — one flag flips a whole posture). The `ci`
profile is a **contract**, not detection: explicit trusted config, headless
credential sources, isolated session/artifact dirs, no prompts, sanitized run
bundle. Precedence: flags > env (`EGO_MODEL`, `EGO_PROFILE`, …) > local >
project > user > system, with system ceilings binding everyone. Credentials
resolve through a source chain (OS keyring, systemd credentials, env,
`credential_command` for Vault/SOPS, device-flow OAuth) via `ego auth` —
never plaintext in config.
